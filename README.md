vessel
======

Vessel is a fast, asynchronous client-server messaging library. Send, receive, and subscribe to messages over channels. The JavaScript client can be found [here](https://github.com/tylertreat/vessel.js).  By default, websockets are used for communication while falling back to other transports if necessary. Messaging via HTTP polling is also supported.
